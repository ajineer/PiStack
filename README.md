# PiStack

Welcome to my first raspberry pi web app, I have decided I want to learn how to deploy and maintain a real website hosted from my raspberry pi 4 computer. I am doing this to practice the full developer cycle. Here is a break down of what I have done so far:

1. install ubuntu server on the raspberry pi 4
2. install node.js and postgreSQL on the rpi 4
3. created a github repo for this project

Next steps:

1. create an node/express js backend, api to interact with a postgreSQL database. Enahance the user model and enable MFA (or 2FA) and OTP's
2. develop or utilize another project's login page with react (maybe the MERN Task master app login page).
3. Deploy on pi and interact with the "Website" on LAN (do not port forward yet! Test everything!).
